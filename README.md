## Abstract
This project explores the development of an immersive, conversational archive experience centered on stereoscopic images from the 1867 Universal Exhibition in Paris. Leveraging EPFL's Panorama+ visualization framework, it integrates historical research with cutting-edge technology to present these images in their intended 3D format. A key feature is a chatbot named Angelus Novus, which uses large language models (LLMs) and NL2SQL technology to facilitate dynamic user interactions, enabling both general and specialist audiences to explore archival materials through conversational search.

The design process incorporated extensive image restoration, manual and automatic annotation, and the use of immersive technologies like Unity and Amazon AWS to develop an interactive prototype. This prototype allows users to navigate historical content via a 360Â° screen and an iPad interface, creating a personalized and socially engaging exploration.

By combining visual and conversational elements, the project revitalizes 19th-century archival materials while fostering critical engagement with themes like colonialism, technology, and cultural exchange. The resulting installation aims to bridge historical narratives and modern interaction paradigms, offering an innovative template for future cultural heritage projects.
